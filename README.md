# Image Compressor

A lightweight and efficient image compression library for Android. It allows you to easily compress images while customizing properties like quality, scale, and resolution. It supports various input types such as `String`, `File`, `Bitmap`, and `Uri`.

Add it to your build.gradle with:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```
and:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.sonsation:image-compressor:1.0.0'
}
```

## Features

- Compress images with customizable quality and scale
- Supports multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Resize images to a specified width and height
- Supports applying custom constraints to the compression process
- Save compressed images to a custom directory

## Installation

### Gradle Dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.sonsation:image_compressor:1.0.0'
}
```

## Usage

### Setting Up Compression

To start using the compressor, you can initialize the `ImageCompressor` class with a `Context` and set various parameters to customize the compression.

```kotlin
val compressor = ImageCompressor(context)
```

### Set Input Image

You can set the image to compress using different types of inputs:

```kotlin
compressor.setImage(path: String) // Path to the image file
compressor.setImage(uri: Uri)     // URI of the image
compressor.setImage(file: File)   // File object of the image
compressor.setImage(bitmap: Bitmap) // Bitmap object of the image
```

### Configure Compression Settings

You can configure different compression settings like quality, scale, and size:

```kotlin
compressor.setQuality(quality = 80) // Set image quality (0-100)
compressor.setScale(scale = 0.8f)  // Set scale factor for image resizing
compressor.setMaxWidth(width = 800) // Set max width for resizing
compressor.setMaxHeight(height = 600) // Set max height for resizing
compressor.setFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG) // Set output format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
```

### Apply Constraints

You can apply constraints to the compression process, such as limiting the file size or applying custom transformations.

```kotlin
compressor.setConstraints(constraint) // Set a custom constraint
```

### Get Compressed Image

You can get the compressed image as a `Bitmap` or save it to a file:

```kotlin
val compressedBitmap: Bitmap = compressor.getBitmapImage()
val compressedFile: File = compressor.getFile()
```

### Save Compressed Image

You can save the compressed image to a specific directory or file path:

```kotlin
compressor.save("/path/to/save/directory")
compressor.save(File("/path/to/save/file"))
```

## Constraints

The `Constraint` class allows you to apply custom transformations and filters to the image during the compression process. Each constraint has a priority level, and constraints are applied in order of priority.

### Creating a Custom Constraint

To create your own custom constraint, extend the `Constraint` class and implement the `apply()` method to modify the `Bitmap` as needed. You can also set the priority for the constraint, which determines its order of execution.

```kotlin
class CustomConstraint(priority: Priority) : Constraint(priority) {
    override fun apply(bitmap: Bitmap): Bitmap {
        // Apply your transformation to the bitmap
        // Example: applying a filter, rotating, cropping, etc.
        return bitmap // Return the modified bitmap
    }
}
```

### Applying Constraints

Once you've defined a custom constraint, you can add it to the `ImageCompressor` using the `setConstraints()` method. Constraints will be applied in the order of their priority.

```kotlin
val compressor = ImageCompressor(context)

val customConstraint = CustomConstraint(Priority.HIGH)

compressor.setConstraints(customConstraint)
    .setImage("/path/to/image.jpg")
    .setQuality(quality = 80)
    .setFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG)

val compressedImage = compressor.getBitmapImage()
```

### Priority Enum

The `Priority` enum allows you to define the priority level for constraints. You can choose from different levels such as `MAX`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `MIN`, and `CUSTOM`.

```kotlin
enum class Priority(val value: Int) {
    MAX(0),
    HIGH(1),
    MEDIUM(2),
    LOW(3),
    MIN(4),
    CUSTOM(100),
}
```

By sorting the constraints by their priority, you can control the order in which they are applied to the image during the compression process.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a full example of how to use the `ImageCompressor` class:

```kotlin
val compressor = ImageCompressor(context)

compressor.setImage(path = "/path/to/image.jpg")
    .setQuality(quality = 75)
    .setScale(scale = 0.7f)
    .setMaxWidth(800)
    .setMaxHeight(600)
    .setFormat(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG)

val compressedImage = compressor.getBitmapImage()

// Save the compressed image
compressor.save("/path/to/save/compressed_image")
```
